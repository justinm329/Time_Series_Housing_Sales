# Time_Series_Housing_Sales
The real estate world plays an important role in the economy, contributing to the generation of more jobs and overall wealth. This project will examine the performance of different forecasting methods to predict optimal time frames to purchase or sell a home. Additionally, this project will showcase the most important factors that influence property price to benefit both real estate agents and interested investors. The data set utilized in this study, House Property Sales Time Series set, originated from Kaggle, Inc. The dataset analyzes housing prices in the Australian housing market between 2008 and 2019. This study incorporated four models, linear regression, Holt-winters, ARIMA, and neural networks, for predicting performance in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean percentage error (MPE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results suggested that the linear regression model outperformed the others, achieving a score RMSE of 16,884.78, MPE of -46.18, and MAPE of 46.18.
